# GitHub repo Actions variables (as opposed to secrets — see
# `github-secrets.tf`) managed by the platform stack.

# Terraform-apply Slack channel routing
# ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# `.github/workflows/{governance-watchdog,aegis-terraform,alerts-infra,
# alerts-rules}.yml` each read `vars.TERRAFORM_APPLY_SLACK_CHANNEL` (falling
# back to a hardcoded `#ci-operations` when the variable is unset) to choose
# where `scripts/notify-terraform-apply.mjs` posts its apply-pending
# summary. Before this resource, that fallback only existed as duplicated
# workflow YAML; this makes the routing an explicit, versioned GitHub
# Actions variable instead.
#
# `var.terraform_apply_slack_channel` defaults to the same `#ci-operations`
# value the workflows already fall back to, so the first apply of this
# resource does not change where the notification posts. An operator
# reroutes it by setting the tfvar and re-applying this (manual-apply)
# stack — see `docs/notes/slack-github-subscriptions.md`. The notify bot
# reaches any public channel via its `chat:write.public` scope; a private
# target channel needs a one-time manual `/invite` (the Slack API can't
# self-join private channels).
