  # ── FX weekend suppression ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # FX markets are closed Fri 21:00 UTC → Sun 23:00 UTC, so pools whose
  # oracle feed is an FX rate (EUR, GBP, KES, BRL, …) legitimately stop
  # reporting over weekends. These pools still fire `mento_pool_oracle_ok`
  # correctly when the contract-level expiry is crossed — that path is
  # handled by the separate Oracle Down rule and stays armed always — but
  # the ratio-based liveness thresholds would page every weekend for
  # reasons the operator can't fix.
  #
  # Why PromQL-level gating instead of `grafana_mute_timing`: a mute timing
  # applies to the whole rule (every firing series), so using it here would
  # also silence crypto-pool liveness alerts on weekends. The `pair` label
  # (emitted by metrics-bridge/src/metrics.ts — canonicalised "EURm/USDm",
  # "USDC/USDm", etc.) lets us gate per-series instead.
  #
  # FX classification mirrors `isFxPool` in ui-dashboard/src/lib/tokens.ts —
  # a pair is FX iff at least one leg is NOT in the USD-pegged set. The regex
  # matches the USD-pegged set; apply with `!~` to select FX pairs. Keep in
  # sync with `USD_PEGGED_SYMBOLS` in tokens.ts and the `expectedLabel` pairs
  # in shared-config/__tests__/fixtures/known-pools.json. `USD₮` is the
  # Tugrik-sign USDT variant some sources emit.
  #
  # The `pair=~".+/.+"` guard on the unless-arm in `fx_gated_liveness_ratio_promql`
  # requires a well-formed `token0/token1` label before we silence anything.
  # `metrics-bridge` falls back to `pair = pool.id` (e.g. "42220-0xabc…") when
  # symbol derivation fails — without the guard, an unmapped pool would be
  # treated as FX and have its liveness alerts muted every weekend.
  #
  # Window matches `indexer-envio/config/fx-calendar.json` — close Fri 21:00
  # UTC, reopen Sun 23:00 UTC. day_of_week(): 0=Sun, 5=Fri, 6=Sat.
