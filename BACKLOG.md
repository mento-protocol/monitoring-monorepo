## Homepage Swaps KPI + OG card — include legacy v2 broker swaps

PR #318 (volume v3/v2 split) and PR #322 (cross-fade + pills) cover the
volume _chart_ and _headline_, but the homepage **Swaps** KPI tile
(`page-client.tsx:335`) and the OpenGraph card both still count only
FPMM/VirtualPool swaps via `pools[].swapCount` — they don't include
the v2 Broker→BiPoolManager swaps already indexed as
`BrokerDailySnapshot` (filtered to `routedViaV3Router=false`).

Small follow-up PR:

- [ ] Sum `BrokerDailySnapshot.swapCount` (where `routedViaV3Router =
false`) across the chosen window into the Swaps tile, alongside
      the existing FPMM count. Matches how the Volume chart already
      composes both rollups.
- [ ] Apply the same v2 inclusion to the OG card's swap-count fallback
      (`opengraph-image.tsx`).
- [ ] Decide on display: a single combined number (most likely) vs.
      two pills like the volume headline. The Swaps tile is smaller
      real estate than the Volume hero; combined number is probably
      right but worth testing in a preview deploy.

## Volume Leaderboard — follow-up PRs after PR 1 (indexer foundation)

PR 1 landed the schema entities + `caller`/`txTo`/`volumeUsdWei` on `SwapEvent` + handler population + `computeSwapUsdWei`. The `TraderDailySnapshot`, `TraderPoolDailySnapshot`, `AggregatorDailySnapshot`, `AggregatorTraderDayMarker`, `TraderPoolDayMarker` entities exist but no handlers write to them yet (empty tables on deploy — fine; PR 2 fills them).

Sequence (each PR self-contained, deploy-able):

- [ ] **PR 2 — Snapshot upsert logic.** In FPMM + VirtualPool swap handlers, upsert `TraderDailySnapshot`, `TraderPoolDailySnapshot`, `AggregatorDailySnapshot`. Use marker entities (`TraderPoolDayMarker`, `AggregatorTraderDayMarker`) to dedupe `uniquePools` / `uniqueTraders` increments. Requires:
  - `src/system-addresses.ts` — `isSystemAddress(chainId, addr)` checking `Pool.rebalancerAddress`, Mento Broker, NTT transceivers (`config/nttAddresses.json`), Yield Split (`feeToken.YIELD_SPLIT_ADDRESS`), treasury contracts. Cache resolved set per chain.
  - `src/aggregators.ts` + `config/aggregators.json` — per-chain `txTo → canonical name` lookup. Seed Squid (Celo: `0xce16F69375520ab01377ce7B88f5BA8C48F8D666`), Jumper/LI.FI (`0x1231DEB6f5749EF6cE6943a275A1D3E7486F4EaE`), 0x ExchangeProxy, 1inch AggregationRouter v6, Paraswap Augustus, OpenOcean Exchange, CoW GPv2Settlement. Verify each address against the canonical docs site before shipping. Monad coverage will be sparse — fine.
  - Returns `"direct"` when `txTo` is the Mento Broker, `"system"` when it's a system address, `"unknown"` otherwise (surfaces gaps for follow-up address curation).
  - Consider adding a top-level `volumeUsdWei` to `TraderPoolDailySnapshot` (alongside the direction-split fields) so the dashboard's per-pool breakdown doesn't need to derive it from inflow+outflow.
  - Characterization tests: feed 5–10 mock `SwapEvent`s with mixed traders/pools/aggregators, assert exact upsert counts and aggregate values.
  - Schema-required, but no breaking changes — full re-sync on branch deploy to populate historical aggregates.

- [ ] **PR 3 — Leaderboard page MVP at `/leaderboard`.** Pure UI/queries, no schema. Reuses `SortableTh`, `Table`, `AddressLink`, `TimeSeriesChartCard`, `useGQL`. Volume hero + sortable table (rank / address / volume / swaps / pools / top-pool / flow badge / fees / last active) + 24h/7d/30d/All window pills + `Show system addresses` toggle + per-row expand for per-pool breakdown. Flow badge from `imbalance = |inflow - outflow| / total` over the trader's primary pool. **Cluster rendering**: when an `aggregator` value matches `cluster-*`, render the row with an info-icon tooltip (text: "These contracts share a deployer EOA — likely one operator running multiple contracts. No project identity confirmed.") and link the icon to the deployer's explorer URL via `getClusterMetadata(name)` from `indexer-envio/src/aggregators.ts`. Clusters are NOT system addresses — they rank alongside real users with the toggle off.

- [ ] **PR 4 — Concentration + cohort + dormancy tiles.** Hero-row tiles. Concentration computed client-side from top-50 `TraderDailySnapshot` rows (Hasura row cap is fine for top-50). Cohort breakdown joins `trader` against Arkham labels in Redis (see `ui-dashboard/src/lib/arkham.ts` for the storage layout). New / dormant counts via current-vs-previous-window `TraderDailySnapshot` first-seen comparison.

- [ ] **PR 5 — Aggregator flow tab.** Pie of share + table (aggregator / volume / unique traders / swap count) + stacked time series. Direct query on `AggregatorDailySnapshot`. Surfaces `unknown` `txTo` addresses prominently so we can curate the aggregator config over time.

- [ ] **PR 6 — Per-pool top-N + outlier-swaps tabs.** Two more tabs below the main table.

- [ ] **PR 7 — Corridor map + LP-friendliness column.** Net-direction graph from `TraderPoolDailySnapshot`; `lpScore = feesPaidUsdWei / max(imbalance × volumeUsdWei, ε)` as a sortable column.

### Cluster aggregator labels — design notes

The `cluster-<first-16-hex-of-deployer-EOA>` aggregator label (added 2026-05-04) flags contracts that share a deployer EOA but have no public project identity (typical MEV/MM operator pattern: one EOA deploys multiple unverified router contracts to shard volume). Currently labels:

- `cluster-7dc08ec28f299c06` (Celo, deployer `0x7dc08ec28f299c062d2941de1f9cfb741df8f022`) — 4 contracts, ~$235k cumulative volume.

Three Celo independents (`0x5dc3065e...`, `0x20216f30...`, `0x03637359...`) and two Monad addresses (`0xdb9b1e94...` MetaMask Delegation Manager, `0xf33cec38...` Gnosis Safe) were investigated 2026-05-04 but deliberately left as `unknown`:

- **Why not label single-contract deployers** (e.g. `0x5dc3065e`)? One contract per deployer = no clustering signal. Without a project identity, labeling adds no information beyond what a per-`txTo` drill-down would already show.
- **Why not preemptively scan deployer histories**? Aggregator-config should reflect contracts we've actually observed driving Mento volume. A periodic audit of the `unknown` bucket (quarterly) is the right cadence to expand this.
- **Why not blanket `mev-*` labels**? "MEV" is an inference about behavior. Cluster grouping is a fact (shared deployer). Stick to facts; let dashboard tooltips explain the "likely MEV / MM" interpretation.

Expansion procedure: when a new entry shows up in the top-N of `AggregatorDailySnapshot.aggregator = "unknown"`, pull `lastSeenAggregatorAddress`, look up the deployer on celoscan/monadscan, and check whether other contracts in our `unknown` bucket share that deployer. If ≥2 contracts cluster, add a new `cluster-<first-16-hex-of-deployer-EOA>` label.

### Deferred from PR 1

- [ ] **`LeaderboardWindowSnapshot` entity for hero metrics.** Originally in the plan but deferred — dashboard can compute totals/top-N share by paginating top-50 from `TraderDailySnapshot` within Hasura's 1000-row cap. Revisit only if the cap becomes a bottleneck (>50 unique traders/day on a single chain whose tail volume materially shifts top-N share).

## Refactor — long files (next candidates after PR #263)

PR #263 split `ui-dashboard/src/app/pool/[poolId]/page.tsx` from 2,831 → 470 lines. Same playbook (characterization tests first, then per-module extraction, snapshot-diff verification per commit) applies to the rest. Ranked by impact × tractability:

### Tier S — clear wins (>1k lines, dense logic)

- [ ] **`indexer-envio/src/rpc.ts` — 1,882 lines.** Indexer RPC adapter (per-method handlers + retry/dispatch). No browser-level tests cover it; characterization tests for retry + dispatch are non-optional before splitting. Highest cognitive-load file in the repo.
- [ ] **`indexer-envio/src/handlers/fpmm.ts` — 1,022 lines.** Split per event type (Swap / Rebalance / LiquidityChange / etc.) — mirrors the pool-page tab split.

### Tier A — UI page refactors (need characterization tests first)

- [x] ~~**`ui-dashboard/src/app/bridge-flows/page.tsx` — 909 lines.**~~ Done in PRs #284 (characterization tests), #287 (TransfersTable + row cells), #289 (RouteDeliveryTile + BridgeOverviewSection). Now 311 lines.
- [x] ~~**`ui-dashboard/src/components/breach-history-panel.tsx` — 823 lines.**~~ Done in PRs #285 (characterization tests), #286 (DurationFilter + BucketFilter), #290 (BreachTable + BreachRow + filter helpers). Now 403 lines.
- [x] ~~**`ui-dashboard/src/app/address-book/AddressBookClient.tsx` — 713 lines.**~~ Done in PRs #283 (characterization tests), #288 (AddressTableRow + row helpers), #291 (ImportDialog + import/export lib). Now 277 lines.

### Tier B — lib/utility splits (low-risk, no UI)

- [x] ~~**`ui-dashboard/src/lib/queries.ts` — split by domain.**~~ Done in PRs #277 (`pools.ts`), #278 (`config.ts`), and the in-flight final slice (`lp.ts` + `ols.ts` + `protocol.ts` + drop exemption). `queries.ts` is now a 6-line barrel.
- [x] ~~**`ui-dashboard/src/app/api/address-labels/import/route.ts` — 808 lines.**~~ Done in PR #280 (handlers extracted to `lib/address-labels/import.ts`; route is now a 103-line HTTP wrapper).
- [x] ~~**`ui-dashboard/src/lib/fetch-all-networks.ts` — 610 lines.**~~ Done in PR #279 (split into `lib/network-fetcher/{types,fetch}.ts`; the original path is a 9-line barrel).

### Tier C — defer (only if related work touches them)

- `indexer-envio/src/pool.ts` (677), `handlers/wormhole/nttManager.ts` (578) — split if working on indexer
- `ui-dashboard/src/components/global-pools-table.tsx` (638) — has 511 lines of tests; low-risk to split, but cognitive load isn't bad
- `lib/rebalance-check.ts` (506), `lib/homepage-og.ts` (494), `breakers.ts` (486) — under the threshold; defer

## Lint hygiene

- [x] ~~**Add an ESLint config to `indexer-envio/`.**~~ Done (this PR): `indexer-envio/eslint.config.mjs` lands with `max-lines: 1000` for `src/**/*.ts`. `.trunk/trunk.yaml` no longer excludes `indexer-envio/**` from the eslint linter, so `trunk check` now lints it. Strict-typescript preset (`tseslint.configs.recommended`) intentionally NOT enabled — would surface ~39 pre-existing nits (no-explicit-any, no-unused-vars, no-require-imports). Backlog item: tighten when the existing nits get cleaned up.
- [x] ~~**Add an `unused-imports` lint rule across all packages.**~~ Done (this PR): `eslint-plugin-unused-imports` wired into all four `eslint.config.mjs` files with `unused-imports/no-unused-imports: "error"`. Caught two real dead imports in `indexer-envio/test/rebalancedUsd.test.ts` and `swap-reserves.test.ts` plus two stale `eslint-disable` directives — all fixed in the same PR.
- [ ] **Enable `tseslint.configs.recommended` on `indexer-envio`.** The current `indexer-envio/eslint.config.mjs` deliberately omits the strict-typescript preset (and `js.configs.recommended`) so the gating PR didn't surface unrelated pre-existing nits. Flipping it on requires fixing roughly 39 errors first: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` (mostly in `test/rpcCache.test.ts`), `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` (test files, plus a few `assigned but never used` cases in src), `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` (`test/dynamicRegistration.test.ts` uses `require()` on rescript-emitted .res.js modules — needs a per-file `require-imports` exemption or a dynamic `import()` rewrite). When fixing, also add `globals: globals.node` to the config's `languageOptions` block (otherwise `no-undef` flags `process`, `Buffer`, etc.), and re-add the `@eslint/js` + `globals` devDeps that were dropped because the scoped config doesn't reference them. Mirror the metrics-bridge / shared-config layout once the cleanup lands.

## Follow-ups deferred from PR #288 (address-book extract)

- [ ] `_lib/address-book-rows.test.ts` — `buildContractRows`, `buildCustomRows`, `filterRows`, and `unknownChainNetwork` are currently covered only through the 38 characterization tests in `AddressBookClient.test.tsx`. A dedicated unit-test file for the lib module (especially `unknownChainNetwork`'s fallback sentinel values) would tighten the safety net independently of the UI.

## Cosmetic follow-ups deferred from PR #263

Pre-existing behavior carried over verbatim from the monolithic pool page; flagged by claude[bot] review but kept out of scope of the refactor PR.

- [ ] `_tabs/reserves-tab.tsx` — `<Th align="right">Total (USD)</Th>` is rendered unconditionally even when `showUsd` is false (cells then show `—`). Mirror the `LpsTab` pattern: `{showUsd && <Th align="right">Total (USD)</Th>}` plus matching cell wrap.
- [ ] `_tabs/swaps-tab.tsx` — cumulative-stats IIFE block. Replace `{(() => { const last = snapshots[0]; if (!last) return null; return (...); })()}` with `const lastSnapshot = snapshots[0]` above the return + `{lastSnapshot && (...)}`.

## Follow-ups deferred from PR #304 (per-pool revenue leaderboard)

- [ ] **Component-level tests for `RevenueByPoolTable`.** Sort transitions, label fallback (truncated address when `poolLabels` lookup misses), partial-data render when one chain has `feesError`, and the `≈`-prefix per-window scoping. Both `/review` (65 conf) and Cursor flagged the gap. Helpers (`aggregateProtocolFeesByPool`) are well-covered; the stateful UI is not.
- [x] ~~**Tests for `useProtocolFees` orchestration.**~~ Done: `src/hooks/__tests__/use-protocol-fees.test.ts` — 13 tests covering happy path, fees/rates/labels rejection, all-fail, hasura URL guard, and per-chain isolation.
- [x] ~~**URL-persisted sort state on `RevenueByPoolTable` and `GlobalPoolsTable`.**~~ Done in this PR: new `useTableSort<K>` hook in `lib/use-table-sort.ts` reads sort key + direction from search params via `useSearchParams` and writes back via `useRouter().replace()`. Strips params when state matches defaults; canonicalizes malformed/partial URL params on mount so the address bar always describes the rendered state. Per-table `paramPrefix` (`leaderboard`, `pools`) keeps params from colliding. Smoke integration tests on both real consumers verify the wiring (URL state → `aria-sort`).
- [x] ~~**Per-chain truncation flag on the leaderboard.**~~ Done in PR #306: `buildRows` derives per-window flags from each chain's `isTruncated` AND the oldest returned transfer's timestamp vs each window's lower bound, so a window is flagged only when the cap actually clipped data inside it. Each `FeeColumn` carries a `truncatedField` symmetric to `unpricedField`; `approxAnnotation(row, column)` checks both per column. Tests cover all (truncated × unpriced) combinations and per-window cases (oldest-older-than-30d → only All-time; oldest-inside-30d → 30d + All-time; etc.).
